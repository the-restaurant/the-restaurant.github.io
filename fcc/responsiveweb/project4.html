          FoobyScript is a programming language created by Meep Fooby. FoobyScript is an offshoot of JavaScript and TypeScript. Its syntax is extremely similar to both and only has minor differences. The biggest difference between FoobyScript and its contemporaries is that FoobyScript is not meant to run in the web browser, or any other environment that runs JavaScript, either as compiled to machine code or interpreted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantage of this is that FoobyScript can be optimized to run on its target hardware, the Sony CrabStation.

          I would be surprised if you didn't know that already.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, you should know JavaScript or TypeScript cause it's basically the same as those. Here's what the code looks like:
        </p>
        <code>
          var my_var = 78;<br>
          con my_constant = "hello";
        </code>
        <p>
          Here is FoobyScript's "Hello World":
        </p>
        <code>
          con hello = "hello";<br>
          var world = "w";<br>
          world += "orld";<br>
          console.log(hello+" "+world);
        </code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
      <header>
        <h2>Data Types</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          FoobyScript has 4 different data types. Data types are types of data. FoobyScript has four.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's what they are:
        <ul>
          <li class="data-types">Number</li>
          <li class="data-types">String</li>
          <li class="data-types">Meep</li>
          <li class="data-types">Secret</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          You won't even see them used here:
        </p>
        <code>
          var my_var = 78;<br>
          con my_constant = "hello";
        </code>
        <p>
          Here is FoobyScript's "Hello World":
        </p>
        <code>
          con hello = "hello";<br>
          var world = "w";<br>
          world += "orld";<br>
          console.log(hello+" "+world);
